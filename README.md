## Build

Install the vulkan sdk on the official website and enable everything except for Volk if you don't want it, then just compile with cmake.

every other dependency is already in the external folder.

## Platform

This code has only been tested in Windows but in theory if you modify the cmakelists.txt file you should be able to run it in linux too.
